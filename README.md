# Robocall Masters

#### An Open Source Tool that allows users to send out robocalls to their cutomers using Africa's Talking Voice

This project focuses on trying to make it easier to reach your customers with important information. Caution should be exercised if the content for the call could be considered spam.

## Important Requirements

To make full use of this platform, you will need a phone number from Africa's Talking. To get one reach out to [voice@africastalking.com](mailto:voice@africastalking.com)

You will also need to set up Text to Speech on Google Cloud. They still offer some of the best text to speech APIs on the market.

## Deployment

This app is designed to be shipped as a container for use on cloud platforms. Any would do, however, these are my recommendations:

1. Heroku
2. Microsoft Azure
3. Google Cloud Platform

## AOB

Look forward to more projects that focus on creating interesting customer experiences.
